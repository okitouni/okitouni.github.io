It can force trained models to have the same response across different values of the protected attribute but it can also go beyond simple decorrelation. For example, MoDe can constrain the response function to be linear or quadratic in the protected attribute.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Controlling Classifier Bias with Moment Decomposition: A Method to Enhance Searches for Resonances","type":"publication"}]
