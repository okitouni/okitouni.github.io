I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the Lab for Nuclear Science and the Statistics and Data Science Center at MIT. As a Junior Investigator at the Institute for AI and Fundamental Interactions, I am mainly interested in research at the interface between machine learning and physics. 
Problems I work on include AI robustness, fairness, and interpretability applied to high energy physics. 
I am also interested in understanding deep learning foundations using tools from theoretical physics.
