I am a Ph.D. student at MIT and a Junior Investigator at the Institute for AI and Fundamental Interactions. During my Ph.D., I worked a lot in research at the interface between machine learning and physics including AI robustness, fairness, and interpretability with applications to high energy physics. 
I am also interested in understanding the science of deep learning and AI foundations. Recently, I've been very excited about AI reasoning, multi-modal foundation models, safe and scalable deep learning.
During my time at Microsoft Research, I worked on knowledge base generative models as part of a knowledge-augmented LLM approach to improving interpretablilty and limit hallucination in critical environments.
