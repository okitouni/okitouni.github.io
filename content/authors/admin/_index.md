I am a Ph.D. student at MIT in the Institute for AI and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI). In the past, I worked a lot in research at the interface between machine learning and physics including AI robustness, fairness, and interpretability with applications to physics. 
I am also interested in understanding the science of deep learning and AI foundations. Recently, I've been very excited about AI reasoning, multi-modal foundation models, safe and scalable deep learning.
During my time at Microsoft Research, I worked on developing a knowledge base generative model towards a knowledge-augmented LLM approach to improving interpretability and limit hallucination.
